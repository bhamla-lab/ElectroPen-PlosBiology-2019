OverviewThis repository includes all relevant .stl/.f3d files, MATLAB plotting/smoothing code, and raw pulse data for the PLoS Biology manuscript titled: “ElectroPen: An ultra-low-cost, electricity-free, portable electroporator.”3D-Printing FilesWe have included 2 different files in this repository for the case design for the ElectroPen. We recommend printing all pieces from the file called “ElectroPen Casing.f3d” as well as the toggle piece from the file called “ElectroPen STL File.stl” in order to have a stronger casing. All pieces from the latter file can also be used alternatively, however, the wire passthroughs at the bottom are relatively more delicate.
